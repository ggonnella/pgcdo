# PGCDO: Prokaryotic Genomic Content Definition Ontology

In comparative genomics, sometimes, expectations are expressed, about
the contents of a genome in given groups of organims (e.g. based on their
taxonomy, phenotype or habitat).

Enabling the description and verification of such expectations requires to
define exactly the genomic contents.
The Prokaryotic Genomic Content Definition Ontology is a framework which
enables such definitions.
In particular, it defines \textit{genomic attributes} as measurable/observable
quantities in a genome. Thereby, it
differentiates the object of a measurement (called here
\textit{genomic content unit} and other variables of the required
measurement itself (such as the \textit{measurement mode} and \textit{measurement
region}).

## Ontology files

The ontology is defined using the OBO format and consists of a single file
(``pgcdo.obo``).
